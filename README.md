To-Do List App with Priority Management (MVP Architecture)

This project is a simple, structured To-Do List application built as part of an Android specialist course to practice clean coding principles. Developed with the **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** architecture, it allows users to create, prioritize, and manage tasks effectively.

Key Features:
- **Task Prioritization**: Set priority levels (Low, Medium, High) to organize tasks based on importance.
- **CRUD Operations**: Easily create, edit, and delete tasks for efficient task management.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Implements MVP architecture to enhance modularity, making the codebase easier to maintain and scale.
